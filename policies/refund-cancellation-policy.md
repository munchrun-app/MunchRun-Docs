# MunchRun Refund and Cancellation Policy

## Overview

This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines the circumstances under which customers can request refunds or cancel orders on the MunchRun platform. We strive to be fair to both our customers and restaurant partners while maintaining a sustainable business.

## Order Cancellations

**Customer-Initiated Cancellations:**

*   **Before Restaurant Confirmation:** Customers can cancel their order without penalty if the restaurant has not yet confirmed the order. A full refund will be issued.
*   **After Restaurant Confirmation:**
    *   If a customer cancels after the restaurant has confirmed the order but *before* a driver has been assigned, a cancellation fee may apply. This fee will be a small percentage of the order total (e.g., 5-10%) to cover the restaurant's costs for any food already prepared.
    *   If a customer cancels after a driver has been assigned, a cancellation fee will apply. This fee will be a larger percentage of the order total (e.g., 20-30%) to compensate both the restaurant for food prepared and the driver for their time.
    *   The specific cancellation fees and timeframes will be clearly displayed in the app during the cancellation process.
*   **Cancellation Due to Excessive Delay:** If an order is significantly delayed beyond the estimated delivery time (e.g., more than 30 minutes late) due to factors within MunchRun's or the restaurant's control, the customer may be eligible to cancel the order without a cancellation fee and receive a full refund.

**MunchRun-Initiated Cancellations:**

*   MunchRun reserves the right to cancel an order in exceptional circumstances, such as:
    *   Restaurant is unexpectedly closed or unable to fulfill the order.
    *   No drivers are available to deliver the order within a reasonable timeframe.
    *   Safety concerns or unforeseen events (e.g., extreme weather).
*   In such cases, the customer will receive a full refund.

**Driver-Initiated Cancellations:**

*   Drivers are able to cancel an order before pickup, although this will affect their acceptance rating.
*   If a driver cancels an order before pickup for reasons outside of their control (e.g. excessive wait time), the order will be reassigned to another driver without penalty to the customer.
*   If a driver cancels for reasons deemed to be within their control, and the restaurant has already prepared the food, MunchRun may deduct the cost of the prepared food from the driver's earnings, up to the value of the food.
*   Drivers are unable to cancel an order once they have picked it up from the restaurant unless a delivery is unable to be made to a customer requesting "Hand it to Me" and reasonable attempts to contact the customer have been made.

## Refunds

**Eligibility for Refunds:**

Customers may be eligible for a full or partial refund in the following situations:

*   **Incorrect Order:** The order received is incorrect (e.g., wrong items, missing items).
*   **Damaged or Unacceptable Quality:** The food is damaged, spoiled, or significantly below the expected quality standard.
*   **Excessive Delay:** The order is delivered significantly later than the estimated delivery time (e.g., more than 30 minutes late) due to factors within MunchRun's or the restaurant's control.
*   **Non-Delivery:** The order is not delivered at all.

**Requesting a Refund:**

*   Customers can request a refund directly through the MunchRun app within \[Timeframe] (e.g., 24 hours) of order delivery or cancellation.
*   To request a refund, customers should:
    1.  Go to the "Order History" section of the app.
    2.  Select the relevant order.
    3.  Tap the "Help" or "Report an Issue" button.
    4.  Choose the reason for the refund request (e.g., "Incorrect order," "Damaged food," "Late delivery").
    5.  Provide a detailed description of the issue and upload photos as evidence, if applicable.

**Refund Processing:**

*   Refund requests will be reviewed by MunchRun's customer support team.
*   We may contact the customer, the restaurant, or the driver for further information.
*   To prevent fraud, supporting evidence, such as photos, may be required for a refund to be approved. Repeated or suspicious refund requests may result in account suspension or deactivation.
*   Refund decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all available information.
*   Approved refunds will be processed within 5-10 business days and credited back to the original payment method.
*   In some cases, a partial refund or a MunchRun credit may be offered instead of a full refund.

**Situations Where Refunds May Not Be Granted:**

*   **Change of Mind:** Refunds will generally not be granted for orders that are canceled due to a customer's change of mind after the restaurant has confirmed the order.
*   **Minor Inaccuracies:**  Minor inaccuracies in the order that do not significantly affect the overall quality or value of the meal may not be eligible for a full refund.
*   **Delivery Instructions Not Followed:** If a customer provides incorrect or incomplete delivery instructions, resulting in a delivery issue, a refund may not be granted.
*   **Customer Unavailability:**  If a customer is unavailable to receive a "Hand it to Me" delivery and does not respond to the driver's attempts to contact them, a refund may not be granted.
*   **Late Cancellations:** If a customer cancels an order too late in the ordering process and incurs a cancellation fee.

**Fraud Prevention:**

*   MunchRun takes fraudulent claims very seriously. We have implemented several measures to prevent abuse of our refund policy, including:
    *   **Requiring photographic evidence for claims related to order accuracy or food quality.**
    *   **Monitoring customer accounts for patterns of suspicious refund requests.**
    *   **Cross-referencing refund claims with driver and restaurant feedback, as well as delivery data (e.g., GPS location, timestamps).**
    *   **Investigating any suspected cases of fraud.**
    *   **Taking action against customers, drivers, or restaurants who engage in fraudulent activity, which may include warnings, account suspension, or permanent deactivation.**
