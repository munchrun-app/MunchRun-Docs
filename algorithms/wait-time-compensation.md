# MunchRun Driver Wait Time Compensation

## Overview

This document outlines the policy and procedures for driver wait time compensation at MunchRun. We recognize that drivers' time is valuable, and excessive wait times at restaurants can negatively impact their earnings and overall experience. This policy is designed to compensate drivers for unreasonable delays caused by restaurants.

## Goals

*   **Fair Compensation:**  Provide fair compensation to drivers for time spent waiting for orders beyond a reasonable grace period.
*   **Incentivize Restaurant Efficiency:** Encourage restaurants to prepare orders promptly and minimize driver wait times.
*   **Improve Delivery Times:** Reduce overall delivery times by minimizing delays at the restaurant.
*   **Transparency:**  Clearly communicate the wait time compensation policy to both drivers and restaurants.

## Policy

MunchRun drivers will be compensated for wait times at restaurants that exceed a predefined grace period, according to the following structure:

*   **Grace Period:** The first **5 minutes** of waiting time after the driver confirms their arrival at the restaurant (using the "Arrived" button in the app) are considered a grace period and are **not** compensated.
*   **Compensation Rate (5-20 minutes):** After the 5-minute grace period, drivers will be compensated at a rate of **$0.20 per minute** for the next 15 minutes, up to the 20 minute mark.
*   **Increased Compensation Rate (Beyond 20 minutes):** After 20 minutes of waiting, the compensation rate increases to **$0.50 per minute**.

**Maximum Wait Time Compensation:**

*   To prevent potential abuse and ensure fairness, the maximum wait time compensation for a single order is capped at **50% of the total order value (excluding delivery fee)**. This means that the restaurant will never be charged more than half the value of the order in wait time compensation, regardless of how long the driver waits.
*   However, drivers are **strongly encouraged to unassign from orders with excessive wait times** (e.g., longer than 15-20 minutes) rather than waiting for extended periods. While they will forfeit their wait time pay upon unassigning, this helps them to avoid wasting valuable time that could be spent on other deliveries.

**Rationale for Order Value Cap:**

*   **Protects Restaurants:**  Limits the financial impact on restaurants in cases of extreme delays, preventing potentially unsustainable charges.
*   **Discourages Abuse:**  Reduces the incentive for drivers to intentionally wait for excessively long periods to maximize compensation.
*   **Promotes Efficiency:** Encourages drivers to unassign from orders with unreasonable wait times, freeing them up to accept other deliveries.
*   **Balances Interests:**  Balances the interests of drivers (fair compensation) with the interests of restaurants (reasonable costs).

**Procedure for Drivers:**

1.  **Confirm Arrival:** Upon arrival at the restaurant, drivers **must** tap the "Arrived at Restaurant" button in the MunchRun Driver app. This action starts the clock for wait time tracking and is essential for accurate compensation. The driver must be within the restaurant's geofence for this to work.
2.  **Wait for Order:** Wait for the restaurant staff to prepare the order.
3.  **Communicate Delays:** If the order is significantly delayed, communicate with the restaurant staff to get an estimated time frame and update the customer through the in-app messaging feature, if appropriate.
4.  **Confirm Pickup:** Once the order is ready, collect the order, verify the items, and tap the "Confirm Pickup" button in the app *only when you are physically leaving the restaurant with the order*. This will stop any active wait time compensation.
5.  **Automatic Calculation:** The MunchRun Driver app will automatically calculate any applicable wait time compensation based on the time elapsed between arrival confirmation and pickup confirmation.
6.  **Unassigning:** If the wait time exceeds 15-20 minutes, drivers are **strongly encouraged** to unassign the order. This will allow them to move on to other deliveries and avoid wasting valuable time. While they will forfeit their wait time pay upon unassigning, this is often the more financially prudent decision in the long run.

## Procedure for Restaurants

1.  **Prompt Order Preparation:** Restaurants are expected to prepare orders promptly and efficiently to minimize driver wait times.
2.  **Accurate Ready Times:** Provide realistic estimated ready times for each order. Update the ready time in the restaurant dashboard if significant delays occur.
3.  **Communication with Drivers:**  Communicate clearly with drivers about the status of orders and any anticipated delays.
4.  **Dispute Resolution:** Restaurants will have a mechanism to dispute wait time claims if they believe the driver's reported wait time is inaccurate. This may involve providing evidence, such as timestamps from their POS system or security camera footage.

## Wait Time Tracking and Verification

*   The MunchRun Driver app will automatically track wait times based on the driver's confirmed arrival and pickup times.
*   GPS data will be used to verify that the driver was within the restaurant's geofence during the reported wait time.
*   Restaurant confirmations and communications through the app can also be used as supporting evidence.

## Payment of Wait Time Compensation

*   Wait time compensation will be added to the driver's earnings for the corresponding order.
*   The restaurant responsible for the delay will be charged for the wait time compensation.
*   Wait time compensation will be clearly displayed in the driver's earnings breakdown and in the restaurant's transaction history.

## Dispute Resolution

*   Drivers and restaurants can dispute wait time claims through the MunchRun support system.
*   Disputes will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account GPS data, timestamps, communication logs, and any other relevant evidence.

## Policy Updates

MunchRun reserves the right to modify this Wait Time Compensation Policy at any time. Drivers and restaurants will be notified of any changes.

## Conclusion

This Wait Time Compensation Policy is designed to be fair to both drivers and restaurants while encouraging efficient order fulfillment and a positive delivery experience for everyone. By implementing this policy, MunchRun aims to minimize unnecessary delays, improve driver satisfaction, and build stronger partnerships with restaurants.

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   Order is ready after 4 minutes.
*   Driver confirms pickup.
*   **Result:** No wait time compensation is applied (within the grace period).

**Scenario 2:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   Order is ready after 10 minutes.
*   Driver confirms pickup.
*   **Result:** Driver receives wait time compensation for 5 minutes (10 minutes - 5-minute grace period) \* $0.20/minute = $1.00.

**Scenario 3:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   Order is ready after 25 minutes.
*   Driver confirms pickup.
*   **Result:** Driver receives wait time compensation for 20 minutes (25 minutes - 5-minute grace period). $3.00 (15 minutes \* $0.20) + $2.50 (5 minutes \* $0.50) = $5.50.

**Scenario 4:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   After waiting 18 minutes, the driver unassigns from the order.
*   **Result:** Driver receives no wait time compensation.

**Scenario 5:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   Order is ready after 35 minutes.
*   Order value is $40
*   Driver confirms pickup.
*   **Result:** Driver receives wait time compensation for 30 minutes (35 minutes - 5-minute grace period). $3.00 (15 minutes \* $0.20) + $7.50 (15 minutes \* $0.50) = $10.50. The cap (50% of $40 = $20) is not exceeded.

**Scenario 6:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   Order is ready after 75 minutes.
*   Order value is $30
*   Driver confirms pickup.
*   **Result:**  Driver receives wait time compensation for 60 minutes. $3.00 (15 minutes \* $0.20) + $27.50 (45 minutes \* $0.50) = $30.50. However, the cap is 50% of $30, which is $15. The driver is paid $15 in wait time compensation.

**Scenario 7:**

*   Driver arrives at the restaurant and confirms arrival in the app.
*   Order is ready after 90 minutes.
*   Order value is $150
*   Driver confirms pickup.
*   **Result:**  Driver receives wait time compensation for 60 minutes. $3.00 (15 minutes \* $0.20) + $37.50 (45 minutes \* $0.50) = $40.50. The cap is 50% of $150, which is $75. The driver is paid $40.50 in wait time compensation.
