# MunchRun Business Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-28

## 1. Executive Summary

MunchRun is a new food delivery platform launching in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. We aim to revolutionize the food delivery industry by creating a fairer, more transparent, and sustainable ecosystem for drivers, restaurants, and customers. Unlike existing platforms that often charge high commission fees to restaurants and provide inconsistent earnings for drivers, MunchRun prioritizes:

*   **Fair Driver Compensation:** Dynamic pricing with a competitive base fee, distance-based pay, time/demand multipliers, and a hybrid dynamic minimum earnings guarantee that rewards high-performing drivers while ensuring a safety net.
*   **Restaurant Empowerment:** Zero commission fees for restaurants. Instead, we charge a small, transparent markup on menu items that is visible to customers, allowing restaurants to retain a larger share of their earnings.
*   **Local Focus:** Prioritizing and promoting local, independent restaurants over large chains.
*   **Transparency:** Open communication with drivers, restaurants, and customers about our fee structure, business practices, and algorithms.
*   **Safety:** Implementing measures to discourage unsafe multi-apping and promote responsible driver behavior.
