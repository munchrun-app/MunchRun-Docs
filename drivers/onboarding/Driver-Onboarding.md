## 4. Making Deliveries

This section outlines the step-by-step process of making deliveries with MunchRun.

### Accepting Orders

When you're online and available, you'll receive notifications of new delivery opportunities. Each notification will display:

*   **Restaurant Name and Location:**  Where you'll be picking up the order.
*   **Estimated Distance:** The total distance from your current location to the restaurant and then to the customer.
*   **Estimated Earnings:**  The estimated amount you'll earn for completing the delivery (including base fee, distance-based pay, and any applicable multipliers). This does not include potential tips or the minimum earnings guarantee.
*   **Order Size (if available):** General information about the size of the order.
*   **Time of Order:** When the order was placed.

You'll have a limited time (e.g., 30-60 seconds) to either accept or reject the order. If you don't respond within the time limit, the order will be offered to another driver.

**Remember**: Your acceptance rate is a key performance indicator and affects your eligibility for the minimum earnings guarantee.

### Order Assignment Algorithm

MunchRun uses a smart algorithm to assign orders to drivers. The algorithm prioritizes:

*   **Platinum Tier Drivers:** Drivers who are currently meeting all Platinum tier requirements are given priority for orders.
*   **Proximity:** Drivers who are closest to the restaurant are generally prioritized.
*   **Idle Time:**  Among drivers in the same tier, those who have been waiting longer for an order are prioritized.
*   **Other Factors:** The algorithm also considers factors like vehicle type (for large orders), customer ratings, and recent acceptance and completion rates.

### Navigating to the Restaurant

Once you accept an order, the app will provide you with turn-by-turn navigation to the restaurant's location. You can use the in-app navigation or choose to use your preferred navigation app (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps).

### Picking Up Orders

#### Confirming Arrival

When you arrive at the restaurant, confirm your arrival by tapping the "Arrived at Restaurant" button in the app. This lets the restaurant and the customer know you're there. The app will prompt you to do this when you enter the geofenced area around the restaurant.

#### Verifying Order Details

Upon arrival, check in with the restaurant staff and provide the customer's name or order number. Carefully verify the order details to ensure you're picking up the correct items.

#### Confirming Pickup (Geofencing)

Once you have the order in hand, you **must** confirm the pickup using the "Confirm Pickup" button in the app.  **This button will only become active when you are within the restaurant's geofenced area.** This confirms that you have physically picked up the order and prevents accidental or fraudulent unassignments after leaving the restaurant.

**Important:**  Do not leave the restaurant with the order before confirming pickup in the app.

### Handling Wait Times

We understand that sometimes orders may not be ready when you arrive at the restaurant. Here's how wait times are handled:

*   **Grace Period:** The first 5 minutes of waiting after you've confirmed your arrival are considered a grace period.
*   **Wait Time Compensation:** After the 5-minute grace period, you will be compensated for your wait time at a rate of $0.20 per minute. After 20 minutes from your arrival, this increases to $0.50 per minute. This compensation is paid by the restaurant.
*   **Excessive Wait Times:** If the wait time becomes excessive (e.g., more than 15-20 minutes), you may have the option to unassign the order without penalty to your completion rate. However, you will lose your wait time pay if you opt to do this. See the "Unassigning Orders" section for more details.
*   **Communication:** If the order is delayed, keep the customer informed through the in-app messaging feature.

### Delivering to the Customer

Once you've picked up the order, the app will provide you with navigation to the customer's location.

#### "Hand it to Me" Deliveries

For orders marked "Hand it to Me":

1.  **Communication:** Upon arrival, notify the customer of your arrival (e.g., ring the doorbell, knock, or use the in-app messaging or call feature).
2.  **Verification:** Greet the customer and politely confirm the name on the order.
3.  **Hand-Off:** Hand the order directly to the customer.
4.  **Confirmation:**  Tap the "Confirm Delivery" button in the app *after* you have successfully handed the order to the customer.

**If the Customer is Unavailable:**

1.  **Attempt Contact:** Try to contact the customer at least 2-3 times using both in-app messaging and phone calls.
2.  **Wait:** Wait at the location for a reasonable amount of time (e.g., 5-10 minutes) after the last contact attempt. The app will track this wait time.
3.  **Contact Support:** If the customer is still unreachable, contact MunchRun support for guidance.
4.  **Default to "Leave at Door" (with Photo) or Return:** Depending on the situation and support's instructions, you may be asked to either:
    *   Leave the order in a safe location at the customer's door and take a clear, well-lit photo.
    *   Return the order to the restaurant (you may be compensated for the return trip).
5.  **Compensation:** If a "Hand it to Me" delivery cannot be completed due to customer unavailability, you will receive a portion of the delivery fee, mileage reimbursement, and applicable wait time compensation.

#### "Leave at Door" Deliveries

For orders marked "Leave at Door":

1.  **Follow Instructions:**  Carefully read and follow any specific instructions provided by the customer (e.g., "Leave on the porch," "Ring doorbell and leave at door").
2.  **Photo Requirement:**  **You must take a clear, well-lit photo of the order placed at the customer's doorstep or designated location.** The photo should include a visual element that helps identify the location (e.g., house number, door, or distinctive feature).
3.  **Notification:**  The app will automatically notify the customer that the order has been delivered and include a link to the photo.
4.  **Confirmation:** Tap the "Confirm Delivery" button in the app after taking the photo.

#### Contactless Deliveries

Many customers prefer contactless deliveries. If a customer requests a no-contact delivery, follow the "Leave at Door" procedures, even if they have selected "Hand it to Me." If they have selected "Hand it to Me," but have specified in their instructions to leave it at the door, take a photo as if it were a "Leave at Door" delivery.

### Completing Deliveries

Once you've successfully delivered the order (either handed it to the customer or left it at the door with a photo), tap the "Confirm Delivery" button in the app. This will mark the order as complete and calculate your earnings.

**Pro Tip:** Providing excellent customer service can lead to higher customer ratings and potentially more tips! Be polite, professional, and communicate clearly with customers throughout the delivery process.

## 5. Pay and Earnings

At MunchRun, we believe in fair and transparent compensation for our drivers. This section explains how your earnings are calculated and how you get paid.

### Dynamic Pricing Structure

Your earnings for each delivery are based on a dynamic pricing model that takes into account several factors:

#### Base Fee

Each delivery has a base fee that compensates you for the initial effort of accepting and picking up the order. The base fee can range from $3.50 to $4.50, depending on the time of day and overall demand.

#### Distance-Based Pay

You'll earn an additional amount for every kilometer you drive beyond a set radius (1.5km to 2km) from the restaurant. This rate is typically between $0.60 and $0.80 per kilometer. The distance is calculated based on the most efficient route between the restaurant and the customer's location.

#### Time and Demand Multipliers

To account for variations in demand and traffic conditions, we use time and demand multipliers. These multipliers increase your earnings during peak hours and in areas with high order volume.

*   **Time Multiplier:**
    *   **Off-Peak:** 1x (no multiplier)
    *   **Shoulder:** 1.1x - 1.2x (e.g., late morning, mid-afternoon)
    *   **Peak:** 1.3x - 1.6x (e.g., lunch and dinner rush)
*   **Demand Multiplier:**
    *   **Low Demand:** 1x (no multiplier)
    *   **Medium Demand:** 1.05x - 1.15x
    *   **High Demand:** 1.2x - 1.35x (or higher in exceptional circumstances)

The current multipliers are displayed in the app, so you'll always know when and where you can earn more.

### Hybrid Minimum Earnings Guarantee

MunchRun offers a unique hybrid minimum earnings guarantee (MEG) to provide drivers with a safety net while also rewarding active engagement and good performance. The MEG has two components: a **base guarantee** based on your total online hours and an **active time bonus** based on the time you spend actively fulfilling deliveries.

#### Tiers and Requirements

The MEG is structured in tiers, with increasing earning potential based on your performance:

| Tier      | Acceptance Rate | Completion Rate | On-Time Delivery Rate | Customer Rating | Hours Online (per week) | Base Guarantee | Active Time Bonus | Total Hourly Guarantee (Active Time) |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Base      | N/A             | N/A             | N/A                  | N/A             | N/A                     | N/A             | N/A              | N/A                               |
| Bronze    | Minimum 80%     | Minimum 90%     | Minimum 80%          | Minimum 4.5     | Minimum 20              | $10/hour        | $20/hour          | $30/hour (active)                 |
| Silver    | Minimum 80%     | Minimum 95%     | Minimum 85%          | Minimum 4.7     | Minimum 25              | $11/hour        | $21/hour          | $32/hour (active)                 |
| Gold      | Minimum 85%     | Minimum 97%     | Minimum 90%          | Minimum 4.8     | Minimum 30              | $12.5/hour      | $22.5/hour        | $35/hour (active)                 |
| Platinum  | Minimum 90%     | Minimum 99%     | Minimum 95%          | Minimum 4.9     | Minimum 35              | $14/hour        | $24/hour          | $38/hour (active)                 |

*   **Base (No Guarantee):**  New drivers start in the Base tier and have no minimum earnings guarantee. This allows you to familiarise yourself with the platform and improve your performance metrics. You can progress to the Bronze tier after meeting the Bronze requirements for one week.
*   **Moving Up Tiers:** You can move up one tier per week if you meet the requirements for the next tier.
*   **Moving Down Tiers:** If your performance falls below the requirements for your current tier, you will be moved down one tier at the end of the week.

**Note:** You must maintain a minimum acceptance rate of 80% to be eligible for any tier's MEG.

#### Base Guarantee

The base guarantee is calculated based on your total online hours, regardless of whether you're on a delivery. It provides a minimum level of income for the time you're available on the platform.

#### Active Time Bonus

The active time bonus is earned for every hour you spend actively engaged in a delivery. This includes the time from accepting an order to completing the delivery. The active time bonus is designed to reward you for efficiently completing orders.

**Active Time** includes:
* Time spent driving to the restaurant.
* Time spent waiting at the restaurant (after the initial grace period and with the wait-time compensation applied)
* Time spent driving to the customer.
* Time spent at the customer's location to complete the delivery.

#### How Earnings are Calculated

Your total earnings are calculated as follows:

**Total Earnings = (Base Guarantee \* Total Online Hours) + (Active Time Bonus \* Active Time Hours) + Delivery Fees + Tips + Large Order Bonus (if applicable)**

If your earnings from delivery fees, tips, and bonuses exceed the minimum earnings guarantee, you will be paid the higher amount. The MEG is a safety net, not a cap on your earnings.

**Example 1 (Busy Period):**

*   You are in the Gold tier.
*   You are online for 4 hours.
*   You are actively completing deliveries for 3 hours.
*   You earn $80 in delivery fees from completing 10 deliveries.

    *   Base Guarantee: $12.50/hour \* 4 hours = $50
    *   Active Time Bonus: $22.50/hour \* 3 hours = $67.50
    *   Total Guarantee Earnings: $50 + $67.50 = $117.50
    *   Total Delivery Fees: $80
    *   **Total Earnings:** $80 + $117.50 = $197.50 (You are paid the higher amount, in this case the base + active guarantee, plus delivery fees)
    *   **Effective Hourly Rate:** $49.38/hour

**Example 2 (Slow Period):**

*   You are in the Bronze tier.
*   You are online for 4 hours.
*   You are actively completing deliveries for 1 hour.
*   You earn $10 in delivery fees from completing 1 delivery.

    *   Base Guarantee: $10/hour \* 4 hours = $40
    *   Active Time Bonus: $20/hour \* 1 hour = $20
    *   Total Guarantee Earnings: $40 + $20 = $60
    *   Total Delivery Fees: $10
    *   **Total Earnings:** $10 + $60 = $70 (You are paid the higher amount, in this case the base + active guarantee, plus delivery fees)
    *   **Effective Hourly Rate:** $17.50/hour

### Large Order Bonus

For orders with a total value exceeding $100, a 1% large order fee is applied. As a driver, you'll receive 33% of this fee as a bonus. This is automatically calculated and added to your earnings.

### Wait Time Compensation

You will be compensated for excessive wait times at restaurants. After a 5-minute grace period, you'll receive $0.20 per minute. After 20 minutes of waiting, this increases to $0.50 per minute. This compensation is paid by the restaurant to encourage prompt order preparation.

### Tips

You keep 100% of all tips received from customers. Tips are a great way to boost your earnings, and we encourage you to provide excellent service to increase your chances of receiving tips.

### Payment Schedule

You will be paid weekly via direct deposit to your nominated bank account. Payments are processed every \[Day of the week] and typically arrive in your account within \[Number] business days.

### Viewing Your Earnings

You can view a detailed breakdown of your earnings in the MunchRun Driver app. This includes:

*   Delivery fees
*   Tips
*   Bonuses (Large Order and any Active Time Bonuses)
*   Wait time compensation
*   Minimum earnings guarantee top-ups (if applicable)
*   Historical earnings data

**Pro Tip:** Keep track of your earnings and performance metrics in the app to understand how you're doing and identify areas where you can improve.

## 6. Driver Performance and Metrics

At MunchRun, we believe in recognizing and rewarding drivers who consistently provide excellent service. This section outlines the key performance indicators we track and how they affect your standing on the platform, including your eligibility for the Minimum Earnings Guarantee (MEG).

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

We track the following metrics to assess driver performance:

*   **Acceptance Rate:** The percentage of orders you accept out of all orders offered to you.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of Accepted Orders / Number of Offered Orders) \* 100%
    *   **Importance:** A high acceptance rate demonstrates your commitment to being available and accepting delivery opportunities. It also helps ensure that customer orders are fulfilled promptly.
    *   **Minimum Requirement:** You must maintain a minimum acceptance rate of **80%** to be eligible for the MEG and to progress beyond the Base tier.
    *   **Example:** If you are offered 10 orders in a shift and you accept 8 of them, your acceptance rate for that shift is 80%.
*   **Completion Rate:** The percentage of accepted orders that you successfully complete.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of Completed Orders / Number of Accepted Orders) \* 100%
    *   **Importance:** A high completion rate indicates your reliability in fulfilling the orders you accept.
    *   **Note:** Unassigning an order *before* confirming pickup at the restaurant will impact your acceptance rate, but not your completion rate. Unassigning after pickup is not permitted except in specific circumstances (see the "Unassigning Orders" section).
    *   **Example:** If you accept 10 orders and complete 9 of them, your completion rate is 90%.
*   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** The percentage of your deliveries that are completed on or before the estimated delivery time.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of On-Time Deliveries / Total Number of Deliveries) \* 100%
    *   **Importance:** Meeting estimated delivery times is crucial for customer satisfaction.
    *   **Note:** Factors outside your control (e.g., unusually long restaurant wait times) will be taken into account.
    *   **Example:** If you complete 10 deliveries and 8 of them are delivered on or before the estimated time, your on-time delivery rate is 80%.
*   **Customer Rating:** Your average rating from customers, based on a 5-star scale.
    *   **Importance:** Reflects the overall quality of service you provide to customers.
    *   **Tip:** Providing friendly, professional service and following delivery instructions carefully can help you maintain a high customer rating.
    *   **Example:** If you receive ratings of 5, 4, 5, 5, and 5 from five different customers, your average customer rating is 4.8.
*   **Restaurant Rating:** Your average rating from restaurants, based on a 5-star scale.
    *   **Importance:** Reflects your professionalism and how well you work with our restaurant partners.
    *   **Tip:** Being punctual, polite, and verifying the order before leaving the restaurant will help maintain a high restaurant rating.
    *   **Example:** If you receive ratings of 4, 5, and 5 from three different restaurants, your average restaurant rating is 4.67.
*   **Hours Online:** The total number of hours you are logged into the app and available to receive orders (tracked on a weekly basis).
    *   **Importance:** Used to calculate your base guarantee and, in conjunction with your other KPIs, determines your tier eligibility.
    *   **Example:** If you are logged in and available to receive orders for a total of 30 hours in a given week, your "Hours Online" for that week is 30.

**Tier Movement:**

*   **Moving Up:** Your performance metrics are evaluated each week. If you meet the requirements for a higher tier, you will automatically be moved up by **one tier** at the start of the following week (e.g., Sunday night/Monday morning).
*   **Moving Down:** If your performance falls below the minimum requirements for your current tier in any given week, you will be moved down to the appropriate tier at the end of that week.
*   **One Tier at a Time:** You can only move up or down one tier at a time.

**Example Scenario:**

*   A new driver starts in the **Base** tier.
*   In their first week, they achieve an acceptance rate of 92%, a completion rate of 98%, an on-time delivery rate of 96%, and a customer rating of 4.9, working 20 hours.
*   They meet the requirements for Gold, but they can only move up **one tier at a time**, so they will move to **Bronze** for the following week.
*   In their second week, they maintain similar performance. They will then move up to the **Silver** tier.
*   In their third week, their performance dips, and their on-time delivery rate falls to 84%, and their customer rating falls to 4.6. They would then be moved down to the **Bronze** tier.

**Tracking Your Metrics:**

You can track your current performance metrics in real-time within the MunchRun Driver app. The app will clearly display:

*   Your current Acceptance Rate
*   Your current Completion Rate
*   Your current On-Time Delivery Rate
*   Your average Customer Rating
*   Your average Restaurant Rating
*   Your Hours Online for the current week
*   Your current tier
*   Progress towards the next tier (if applicable)

**Tips for Maintaining High Performance:**

*   **Accept Orders Promptly:** Accept orders as soon as possible to maintain a high acceptance rate.
*   **Communicate with Customers:** Keep customers informed about any delays or issues.
*   **Follow Delivery Instructions:** Pay close attention to customer instructions, especially regarding "Leave at Door" or "Hand it to Me" preferences.
*   **Be Professional:** Maintain a professional demeanor and provide excellent service to both customers and restaurant staff.
*   **Use Your Insulated Bag:** Always use your insulated bag to ensure food quality.
*   **Drive Safely:** Follow all traffic laws and prioritise safety.

## 7. Unassigning Orders

At MunchRun, we understand that there may be circumstances where you need to unassign an order after you've accepted it. While we encourage you to complete all accepted orders, we've designed a system that allows for unassignments when absolutely necessary. This section outlines the policy and procedure for unassigning orders.

**Policy and Procedure:**

*   **Before Pickup:** You may unassign an order **before** confirming pickup at the restaurant. However, excessive unassignments will negatively impact your acceptance rate, which is a key factor in your tier status and eligibility for the Minimum Earnings Guarantee.
*   **After Pickup:** Once you have confirmed pickup at the restaurant using the geofenced "Confirm Pickup" button, you **cannot** unassign the order through the app. If a situation arises that prevents you from completing the delivery after pickup, you must contact MunchRun support immediately for assistance.
*   **Unassigning Process:**
    1.  If you need to unassign an order (before pickup), tap the "Unassign Order" button in the app.
    2.  Select a reason for the unassignment from the provided list.
    3.  Confirm the unassignment when prompted.
*   **Impact on Metrics:**
    *   **Acceptance Rate:** Unassigning an order *before* pickup will lower your acceptance rate.
    *   **Completion Rate:** Unassigning an order *before* pickup will **not** impact your completion rate.
*   **Frequency Limits:**  While there's no strict limit on the number of unassignments, excessive unassignments within a short period may trigger a review of your account. We'll reach out to understand the circumstances.

**Acceptable Reasons for Unassignment:**

We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. Here are some acceptable reasons for unassigning an order *before* pickup:

*   **Restaurant Wait Time is Too Long:**  If the order is significantly delayed at the restaurant (e.g., more than 15-20 minutes beyond the estimated pickup time) despite the wait-time compensation, and you have communicated the delay to the customer.
*   **Order is Unexpectedly Large/Heavy:** If the order is significantly larger or heavier than indicated in the app, and you are unable to safely transport it.
*   **Distance to Restaurant is Incorrect:** If the actual distance to the restaurant is significantly further than initially displayed in the app.
*   **Personal Emergency:**  An unexpected event that requires your immediate attention.
*   **Feeling Unwell:** If you become unwell and are unable to complete the delivery.
*   **Vehicle Trouble:**  If you experience a problem with your vehicle that prevents you from completing the delivery.
*   **Safety Concerns:**  If you feel unsafe at the pickup location or for any other reason related to the delivery.
*   **App Issues:** If you are experiencing technical difficulties with the app that prevent you from completing the pickup.
*   **Other:** If you have another valid reason not listed above, select "Other" and provide a brief explanation in the text box.

**Important Note:**  Repeatedly unassigning orders for reasons that are deemed unsubstantiated or frivolous may result in a warning or temporary suspension from the platform.

**Consequences of Excessive Unassignments:**

While we understand that unassignments are sometimes necessary, excessive unassignments can negatively impact the customer experience and the efficiency of the platform.  Therefore:

*   **Impact on Acceptance Rate:** As mentioned, each unassignment will lower your acceptance rate.
*   **Tier Status:**  A low acceptance rate can affect your ability to progress to higher tiers in the Minimum Earnings Guarantee program or even maintain eligibility for the guarantee.
*   **Account Review:**  If your unassignment rate is unusually high, your account may be reviewed, and we may reach out to you to discuss the reasons for the unassignments.
*   **Potential Deactivation:**  In cases of repeated or egregious violations of this policy (e.g., unassigning after pickup without authorization, repeatedly unassigning without valid reasons), your account may be temporarily suspended or permanently deactivated.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Communicate:** If you encounter a problem that might lead to an unassignment, communicate with the restaurant and/or the customer through the app to keep them informed.
*   **Contact Support:** If you're unsure whether it's appropriate to unassign an order, or if you need assistance, contact MunchRun support for guidance.
*   **Prioritize Completion:**  Whenever possible, try to complete orders you have accepted. This helps maintain a positive experience for customers and restaurants and contributes to your overall success on the platform.

## 8. Safety and Security

At MunchRun, the safety and security of our drivers, customers, and restaurant partners are our top priorities. This section outlines important safety guidelines and procedures.

### Safe Driving Practices

As a MunchRun driver, you play a crucial role in ensuring road safety. Always adhere to the following:

*   **Obey All Traffic Laws:**  Follow all traffic signals, speed limits, and road rules.
*   **Avoid Distracted Driving:**  Do not use your phone for calls, texting, or other non-essential activities while driving. Pull over to a safe location if you need to use your phone. Only use your phone for activities relating to the app, such as accepting an order.
*   **No Impaired Driving:** Never drive under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any medication that may impair your ability to drive safely.
*   **Maintain Your Vehicle:** Ensure your vehicle is in good working order, with proper tire pressure, functioning lights, and regular maintenance.
*   **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:** Pay attention to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, especially in busy areas.
*   **Adjust to Conditions:** Adapt your driving to weather conditions (rain, fog, etc.) and traffic.
*   **Park Safely:**  Park legally and safely at both restaurants and customer locations. Avoid blocking traffic or creating hazards.
*   **Report Unsafe Conditions:** If you encounter any unsafe road conditions or hazards, report them to the appropriate authorities and to MunchRun support.

### Food Safety and Hygiene

Maintaining food safety is crucial for protecting the health of our customers and upholding MunchRun's reputation. Follow these guidelines:

*   **Use Insulated Bags:** Always use your MunchRun-provided (or equivalent) insulated bags to transport orders. Ensure the bags are clean and in good condition.
*   **Temperature Control:** Keep hot food hot and cold food cold. Separate hot and cold items within your bag if necessary.
*   **Handle Food with Care:** Avoid touching food directly. Use utensils or napkins provided by the restaurant.
*   **Secure Packaging:** Make sure food containers are properly sealed and secured to prevent spills or leaks.
*   **Cleanliness:** Maintain a clean and hygienic environment in your vehicle.
*   **Allergens:** Pay close attention to any allergen information provided with the order and ensure that these requirements are met during delivery.

### Personal Safety

Your personal safety is paramount. Follow these tips to stay safe while on delivery:

*   **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:**  Pay attention to your surroundings, especially when making deliveries at night or in unfamiliar areas.

*   **Limit Cash:** Avoid carrying large amounts of cash.
*   **Secure Your Vehicle:** Keep your vehicle locked when unattended.

*   **Emergency Contacts:** Keep emergency contact numbers readily available.
*   **Share Your Location:** Consider sharing your location with a trusted friend or family member while you're online.

### Reporting Safety Concerns

If you have any safety concerns during a delivery, or if you witness any unsafe behavior, report it to MunchRun support immediately through the app or by phone at \[Phone Number].

### Accident Procedures

In the event of an accident:

1.  **Ensure Safety:**  First, ensure your safety and the safety of others involved. Move to a safe location if possible.
2.  **Contact Emergency Services:** If there are any injuries or significant damage, call emergency services (000) immediately.

6.  **Contact Your Insurance:**  Contact your insurance company to report the accident and file a claim.

### Multi-Apping Guidelines

While we understand that drivers may use multiple delivery apps, we strongly discourage engaging in multi-apping in a way that compromises safety or negatively impacts the MunchRun platform.

*   **Prioritize Safety:**  Never use multiple apps in a way that distracts you from driving safely.
*   **Maintain Timeliness:**  Do not accept orders on multiple apps if it will prevent you from completing MunchRun deliveries on time.
*   **Focus on MunchRun Orders:** While logged into the MunchRun app and on an active delivery, prioritize the timely and safe completion of that delivery.
*   **Unassign if Necessary:**  If accepting an order on another app will significantly delay a MunchRun delivery, unassign the MunchRun order (before pickup) following the proper procedure.

**Remember:** Unsafe or excessive multi-apping that leads to delays, poor customer ratings, or safety violations may result in warnings, suspension, or deactivation from the MunchRun platform.
