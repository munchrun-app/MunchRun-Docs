# MunchRun Restaurant Payout Calculations

## Overview

This document outlines how restaurant payouts are calculated on the MunchRun platform. Our core principle is to empower restaurants by offering a **zero-commission** model, ensuring they receive the maximum possible share of their earnings.

## Key Principles

*   **No Commission Fees:** MunchRun does **not** charge restaurants any commission fees on orders.
*   **Transparent Markup:** A small, clearly displayed markup is added to menu items. This markup is visible to customers during the ordering process and is collected by MunchRun.
*   **Prompt Payouts:** Restaurants receive timely and reliable payouts for their orders.

## Payout Calculation

The payout for each restaurant order is calculated as follows:

**Restaurant Payout = (Order Subtotal - Markup) + Large Order Bonus (if applicable) - Wait Time Compensation (if applicable) +/- Adjustments (if applicable)**

**Where:**

*   **Order Subtotal:** The total value of all food and beverage items in the order *before* the MunchRun markup is added.
*   **Markup:** A small percentage (2-3%) added to each menu item. This markup is collected by MunchRun to cover operational costs and ensure fair driver compensation. The exact markup percentage is communicated to restaurants during onboarding.
*   **Large Order Bonus:** For orders with a total value exceeding $100 (after the markup is applied), a 1% fee is added. The restaurant receives 33% of this fee as a bonus.
*   **Wait Time Compensation:** If a driver experiences an excessive wait time at the restaurant (beyond the grace period), the restaurant is responsible for compensating the driver. This amount is deducted from the restaurant's payout.
*   **Adjustments:** Any necessary adjustments, such as refunds to customers due to order errors or other issues, will be deducted from the restaurant's payout.

**Example:**

*   Order Subtotal (before markup): $50.00
*   Markup: 2%
*   Menu Total: $51 (Price shown to customer)
*   Large Order Bonus: $0 (order total is less than $100)
*   Wait Time Compensation: $2.00 (due to a 15-minute wait beyond the grace period)
*   Adjustments: $0

**Calculation:**

```
Restaurant Payout = ($50.00) + $0 - $2.00 - $0
                   = $48.00
```

**In this example, the restaurant receives $48.00 for the order.**

## Large Order Bonus (Orders Over $100)

*   A 1% fee is added to orders with a total value exceeding $100 (after applying the markup).
*   The restaurant receives 33% of this fee as a bonus.
*   **Example:** For a $120 order, the large order fee is $1.20. The restaurant receives a bonus of $0.40.

## Wait Time Compensation

*   Restaurants are responsible for compensating drivers for excessive wait times.
*   **Grace Period:** The first 5 minutes of driver wait time are considered a grace period.
*   **Compensation:**
    *   $0.20 per minute for minutes 6-20.
    *   $0.50 per minute after 20 minutes.
*   **Maximum Wait Time Compensation:** Capped at 50% of the order value (excluding the delivery fee).
*   **Disputes:** Restaurants can dispute wait time claims if they believe they are inaccurate.

## Adjustments

*   Adjustments may be necessary in cases of order errors, refunds to customers, or other exceptional circumstances.
*   Any adjustments will be clearly documented and communicated to the restaurant.

## Payout Schedule

*   Restaurants are paid on a Weekly basis.
*   Payments are made via direct deposit to the restaurant's nominated bank account.
*   The minimum payout amount is $50. If the payout is less than this, it will carry over to the next payout period.
*   A detailed breakdown of each payout is available in the restaurant dashboard.

## Onboarding Fee

*   A one-time onboarding fee of $200 is charged to cover the costs of:
    *   Setting up the restaurant on the MunchRun platform.
    *   Providing and configuring the Android tablet for order management.
    *   Initial training on using the MunchRun system.

## Transparency

*   MunchRun is committed to transparency in all its dealings with restaurant partners.
*   The restaurant dashboard provides detailed information about order breakdowns, payouts, and any applicable fees or adjustments.

## Important Considerations

### Taxes

*   **GST:** All menu prices displayed on the MunchRun platform are inclusive of GST. Restaurants are responsible for remitting these taxes to the appropriate authorities.
*   **Tax Reporting:** MunchRun will provide restaurants with a monthly statement detailing all orders, including the total value of GST collected. This statement can be used to assist with tax reporting.

### Refunds and Order Cancellations

*   **Policy:** In the event of a customer requesting a refund or cancelling an order, MunchRun will review the situation on a case-by-case basis. If the refund or cancellation is due to an error on the part of the restaurant (e.g., incorrect order, missing item), the restaurant may be responsible for the cost of the refund.
*   **Procedure:** Restaurants can manage refunds and cancellations through the MunchRun restaurant dashboard. Detailed instructions are provided in the Restaurant Onboarding Guide.

### Menu Pricing and Markup

*   **Guidance:** While restaurants have full control over their menu pricing, we recommend factoring in the 2-3% markup when setting prices on the MunchRun platform. This will help ensure profitability.
*   **Example:** If you typically charge $20 for an item in-store, you might consider listing it for $20.50 on MunchRun to account for the markup (assuming a 2.5% markup).
*   **Flexibility:** Restaurants have the flexibility to adjust their pricing strategy as needed.

### Marketing and Promotions

*   **Restaurant Control:** Restaurants can create and manage their own promotions and discounts through the MunchRun dashboard.
*   **MunchRun Support:** MunchRun will periodically feature local restaurants and promotions within the app and through our marketing channels.

### Data and Analytics

*   **Access to Data:** Restaurants will have access to a range of data and analytics through their dashboard, including order history, sales trends, customer demographics, and popular menu items.
*   **Data Ownership:** All data generated through the MunchRun platform related to a restaurant's orders and customers will remain the property of the restaurant.

### Dispute Resolution

*   **Process:** If a restaurant disputes a payout, adjustment, or any other issue, they can contact MunchRun support through the restaurant dashboard or by emailing \[Support Email Address]. Disputes will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
*   **Contact Point:** For any questions or concerns regarding payouts or other financial matters, please contact our support team at \[Support Email Address] or through the in-app chat.

### Termination of Partnership

*   **Procedure:** Restaurants can terminate their partnership with MunchRun at any time by providing written notice to \[Email Address or Contact Person].
*   **Data Access:** Upon termination, restaurants will have access to their data for a period of 30 days.

### Changes to the Payout Structure

*   **Notification:** MunchRun reserves the right to modify the payout structure. However, we are committed to providing at least \[Number] days' notice to restaurants of any significant changes.

## Conclusion

MunchRun's zero-commission model, combined with a small, transparent markup and efficient payout system, ensures that restaurants receive a fair share of their earnings. We believe this approach fosters strong partnerships and contributes to a more sustainable food delivery ecosystem. This document will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect any changes to our payout policies.
